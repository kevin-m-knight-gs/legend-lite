/**
 * THE THREE DIALECT LEVELS (user directive 2026-08-12; docs/DIALECT_LEVELS.md).
 * A parser always knows which level it is serving — there is no neutral
 * default a caller can grab by accident.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #LEGEND_PLATFORM} — legend-lite's OWN legend-pure dialect (m3/m2:
 *       {@code #TDS}, {@code ^$x(...)}, {@code native}, generics,
 *       function-type literals, m2 mapping forms). Reachable ONLY from
 *       built-in/bootstrap/platform-source loading and the test harness —
 *       the analogue of legend-engine depending on precompiled legend-pure
 *       jars. Caller-whitelisted ({@code PlatformSurfaceGuardrailTest}).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #LEGEND_ENGINE} — user-facing EXACT legend-engine. The drop-in
 *       surface: PmcdParser, the SPI bridge, byte parity. Refuses BOTH the
 *       platform dialect and the lite extensions, with the engine's own
 *       messages.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #LEGEND_LITE} — {@link #LEGEND_ENGINE} plus the DECLARED lite
 *       extensions (docs/OWN_CORPUS_DECISIONS.md LITE-DESIGN families:
 *       mapping-as-function, inline-association, sqlite-backend,
 *       function-types-generics). The product surface for lite's users. Its whole
 *       delta vs LEGEND must classify to a declared family — nothing
 *       undeclared rides along.</li>
 * </ol>
