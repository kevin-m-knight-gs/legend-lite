 * THE DATABASE-ERROR TRANSLATION (the exception seam, user directive
 * 2026-09-01): a real {@code java.sql.SQLException} raised by the
 * executing database, translated to the platform vocabulary AT THE
 * EXECUTOR BOUNDARY — the one seam that understands JDBC. Everything
 * above the boundary (orchestration, verdict arms, the harness)
 * classifies failures by PLATFORM types only; {@code java.sql} stops
 * appearing in their signatures, which is what lets the JDBC registers
 * genuinely shrink to the executor seam. The original
 * {@code SQLException} rides as the cause; {@code getMessage()} is the
 * database's own text (the raised-message provenance discipline —
 * RaisedErrors — is unchanged and runs before translation).
