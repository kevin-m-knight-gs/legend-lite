"""
Generates graph-fetch instances across the whole model.

The four hand-written GRAPH specs in battery.py each pin a PROPERTY -- nested to-one
navigation, an Operation union with an empty leg, an enum that raises on one execution path
and returns NULL on another, a milestoned class at %latest. Those stay hand-written: each
encodes a piece of knowledge about what graph fetch is supposed to do, and no generator
knows any of it.

What they do not do is scale. They cover four roots out of 209 seeded, because a human
picked four. This generates the INSTANCES those properties should hold over -- tree-shaped
reads across every root the model offers -- while battery.py keeps the properties.

The division is deliberate and is the same one stacks.py makes for projections: hand-write
the judgement, generate the volume. A generated tree asserts only that graph fetch agrees
with the oracle for that shape; it cannot tell you WHY a disagreement matters. When one
fails, the hand-written probe next to it is what explains it.

Two exclusions, both because generating a test that is known to fail buys nothing:

  * ENUM-MAPPED properties. F10: graph fetch RAISES on a source code with no
    EnumerationMapping entry where a TDS projection returns NULL. Every expanded table
    carries such a row by construction, so including enums would generate a corpus of
    uniform, already-understood failures. G3 pins that deliberately, once.

  * TO-MANY navigation. F6: count() over an empty to-many returns 1 rather than 0, and A3
    guarantees a childless parent in every expanded table. Trees stay to-one until F6 is
    fixed; the moment it is, lifting this restriction is a one-line change and the fan-out
    is large.
