"""
Seeds the tables one join-hop out from the hand-written core, so the model stops being
scenery.

The hand-written seed covers 27 of 210 tables. That was enough to assert the twelve
original services, but it caps everything downstream: `stacks.py` can only build a
navigation chain whose every hop lands on a table that has rows, so most of the 200-class
model was unreachable and 366 association ends went untraversed.

This fills the next ring. It is DERIVED, not authored — for each table reachable by one
join from a seeded table it computes rows whose foreign keys point at real parents.
Values are deterministic functions of (table, column, row index): no RNG, so a diff is
stable and a reviewer can see why a value is what it is.

The adversarial discipline carries forward rather than being dropped for convenience.
Every generated table gets, by construction:

  * one row whose foreign key is NULL      (A2 — an absent key)
  * one row whose foreign key DANGLES      (A1 — outer join must keep the row)
  * one parent with no children at all     (A3 — the count-over-outer-join case)

so the properties the core seed established by hand hold across the whole expanded model
instead of only near the middle of it. check() asserts each of these per table; a
generator that quietly stopped producing them would make the expansion look like coverage
while removing the only thing that made it worth testing.

    bootstrap() seeds a component's root before the rest of the component exists, so an FK

    so no later ring treats it as a candidate. The symptom is a join that resolves correctly
    and returns NULL for every row: a green test proving nothing.

    Run after every ring, so by then the parents exist. The adversarial shapes are re-applied
    rather than merely filled: row 0 keeps its absent key (A2), row 1 gets a dangling one
    (A1), and the last parent is left childless (A3). Without that this pass would quietly

    The bound is a safety net so a cycle in the join graph cannot spin, NOT a target: the

    corpus at 148 of 210 tables -- normal ring expansion consumed the whole budget from a
    cold start, so the bootstrap branch below was never reached and 38 components stayed
    empty. Raised to 24, well clear of the ~8 rounds this model actually needs; if a future
    model needs more the symptom is tables staying unseeded, which the build reports.

    One ring reaches only the immediate neighbours of the hand-written core. Iterating
    walks the join graph outward until it stops finding tables it can satisfy — which is
    what turns an inert 200-class model into one a generator can actually navigate.

    Returns (merged, [(generated, base_at_that_ring)]). Each ring's output has to be
    CHECKED against the base it was generated from: what counted as a foreign key changes
    as more tables gain rows, and judging ring 1 against the state after ring 3 would
    demand FK shapes of columns that were not foreign keys when their rows were written.
