"""Heavily STACKED query shapes over the models the corpus already has.

The corpus is deep in mapping mechanics and shallow in query shape. Measured over 2301
services: a mean of 1.75 distinct query features each, 88% navigating a single hop, 5% with
a filter, 3% with an aggregate, 1% with a groupBy. Most of the fan-out is one bare projection
per subtype set, of which there are 1828 -- breadth of model, not depth of query.

That imbalance shows in the findings. F50-F54 came from query shape, back when that was the
only dimension the corpus had. F55, F56 and F57 all came from mapping structure, which is the
dimension that has been deepened since. We have been mining the seam we dug.

So this digs the other one. It does NOT touch the existing services: a bare projection over a
subtype is the only thing that makes a wrong `~filter` visible -- a wrong filter returns the
WHOLE table rather than erroring -- and a stacked query over the same rows is only
interpretable if a simple one over them passes. Same models, same seed, new services, and the
pair is a differential rather than a replacement. That split has already paid twice:
aggregates.py against tomany.py around F6, and CB_NotEqualsNull around F28.

Five variants per root, each a different way to be complex, so the output does not collapse
into one shape the way stacks.py does (it dedupes by tree signature and saturates at ~45):

  DEEP    the longest to-one chains the model offers, filtered ON A NAVIGATED column rather
          than a local one, composite-sorted, limited
  GROUP   the same reach, then groupBy on a NAVIGATED key with aggregates over it
  TREE    a graphFetch three levels deep
  TREE    a graphFetch three or four levels deep
  SUB     rooted at a SUBTYPE set that navigates its OWN ends. This currently emits NOTHING,
          and the zero is the finding rather than a bug in the generator: every subtype set
          in the corpus reaches other classes only through ends it INHERITS, and F49 makes
          those unnavigable from the subtype's set. The variant is kept so that the day a
          subtype declares an end of its own, it is covered.
  QUAL    derived and qualified properties -- the ones taking arguments -- evaluated at the
          END of a chain rather than on the root
  LOCAL   a filter, a derived property, a composite sort and a limit stacked on a root that
          cannot navigate at all
  AGG     groupBy on a local key with two aggregates over it

The last two exist because of a hard ceiling. Only 45 of 2009 seeded roots can navigate ANY
chain: 1838 of them are subtype sets, and F49 makes an end inherited from a supertype
unnavigable from the subtype's set -- fatal at initialisation, so it cannot even be
quarantined. Depth is therefore unavailable on nine tenths of the corpus's roots, and what
IS available there is stacking width: predicate, aggregation, ordering and computation over
the rows a `~filter` selects. That is still four or five features where there was one.

What is deliberately NOT stacked, because a stack containing a known defect is red for a
reason nobody has to look for and masks the interaction it exists to find:

  F6   aggregates over a to-many end where some parent has no children. Avoided by
       construction: GROUP aggregates over PROJECTED ROWS, not over a to-many navigation.
  F14  groupBy over a many-to-one enum mapping -- enum-typed columns are never group keys.
  F28  `!=`, which keeps a row whose operand is NULL where `==` and `>` drop it.
  F55  a graphFetch edge leaving a mapping for one that mapping includes.
  F49  an end inherited from a supertype, navigated from a subtype set.
