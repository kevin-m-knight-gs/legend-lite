"""
Generates DENSE services — many features in one query — instead of one probe per feature.

The corpus grew as a set of narrow probes: median 2 features per service. That is right
for ATTRIBUTION (F10, F12, F13 and F15 are each reportable because they were isolated) and
wrong as the whole corpus, because a defect that only appears when several features
interact is invisible to a probe by construction. F14 is the proof: groupBy over a
many-to-one enum mapping, findable only by stacking.

So this generates the other layer. For each root class it takes what the MODEL actually
offers — the deepest navigation chains, any enum-mapped column, any derived property —
and stacks them into one query with a filter, a sort and a limit on top. Generated from
the model rather than hand-written, so it grows as the model does instead of needing a new
hand-authored service per domain.

Two rules keep the output meaningful:

  * Nothing quarantined goes in. A stack containing a known defect is red for a reason
    nobody has to look for, and masks every interaction it exists to find. Aggregates over
    a to-many are therefore excluded while F6 stands, and groupBy over an enum while F14
    does.
  * A service must reach MIN_FEATURES or it is not emitted at all. A "stack" of three
    features is a probe wearing a bigger name.
