"""
Derives TRADE_FLAT — the denormalized reporting table — from the normalized seed.

This file is short and the reason for it is the whole point of L2.

Mapping invariance says: the same query, asked through two semantically equivalent
mappings, must return the same rows. It is the strongest assertion in the corpus because
it needs no oracle — a violation is unambiguously an engine defect, not a disagreement
about what the answer should be.

That only holds if the two shapes really do carry the same information. Hand-authoring
TRADE_FLAT would break exactly that: one transcription slip and the "invariance failure"
is a fixture bug wearing an engine bug's clothes, which is worse than no test. So the flat
rows are COMPUTED from the normalized rows by walking the same joins the normalized
mapping walks, using the same resolver.

The NULLs matter most. TRD-0007 points at a counterparty that does not exist and two
trades carry no trader, so the flat row must hold NULLs in those columns — precisely what
the outer join produces on the normalized side. Encoding the join RESULT, not the join
INPUT, is what makes the two paths comparable.
