"""
The fan-out battery — the half of L0 the original 12 services could not reach.

All 530 projection paths in the 12 stress services are to-one navigations. That was
measured, not assumed (`python3 query.py` reports "0 cross a to-many hop"). It means the
corpus exercised outer joins that land on at most one row and never one that fans out —
and fan-out is where the interesting defects live.

Specifically, `count()` over a to-many association compiles to an aggregate over a LEFT
OUTER JOIN. An entity with no children still contributes one all-NULL joined row, so an
implementation that emits `COUNT(*)` rather than `COUNT(child_key)` returns **1** where
the answer is **0**. It is a silent wrong answer: no error, no empty result, just a count
that is too high by one for exactly the rows a naive fixture would not contain.

The seed was built with that in mind. Every root below has at least one childless member:

  INST-NESN    listed, never traded, no positions, no greeks
  CP-0005      onboarded, never traded with, no settlements, no CSA
  BK-LEGACY    closed book, no trades, no PnL
  DSK-CREDIT   no books, no traders, no PnL
  SEC-55       no instruments
  POS-0003/4/6 no greeks

Each service pairs identifying columns with several `->count()` projections, so one row
carries several independent assertions and a defect in any one of them reddens the suite.
