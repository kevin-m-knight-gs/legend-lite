"""
Generates the COMBINATION matrix: mapping features stacked on each other, not merely present.

The taxonomy reached "35 of 35 features present" while four classes carried every advanced
construct in the corpus and exactly two pairs ever co-occurred (chain+dyna on one class,
binding+embedded on another). Presence is not coverage. A feature that appears once has been
shown to work in one shape, and the defects this corpus has actually found -- concat over
NULL, count over an empty to-many, a chain filter that excluded nothing -- all live at the
point where one feature meets another.

So the axes are enumerated and crossed rather than illustrated:

  PROPERTY axes                            CLASS-MAPPING axes
    reach    col | chain1 | chain2           filter    none | direct | chain
    type     string | int | float | bool     extends   no | yes
    xform    per type -- see XFORM
    nulls    notnull | nullable
    host     top | embedded

The transform axis DEPENDS on the type axis, because a dynafunction's arguments and result
have to agree with the property it maps, so the cross is over the per-type transform lists
rather than one shared list: 180 cells, every one generated. The class cross is 3x2 = 6, and
the property cells are dealt across the six so that each property shape also meets each
class shape. What that buys over 48 separate one-feature tests is the interaction: a
dynafunction over a two-hop chain, inside an embedded block, on a set that extends another
set and carries a filter reached through joins, where the source column is NULL for some rows.

WHY THE SOURCE DATA MATTERS MORE THAN THE MATRIX. Every table here is reachable from the
seed's ordinary expansion, so each foreign key carries the adversarial shapes (absent key,
dangling key, childless parent) and each nullable column carries a NULL. Without that a
combination test is a shape with nothing interesting flowing through it -- which is exactly
what the corpus's first join chain was, resolving for every row because two tables' generated
values coincided.

Nothing here is asserted from engine output. Each generated property is evaluated by
oracle.py from the seed, and a cell whose value the oracle cannot compute independently is
not generated at all -- it is reported by `unsupported()` so the gap is visible rather than
quietly absent.

    state -- `dense_DynaOneSide` and `dense_DynaBothSides` pair ZERO rows with zero, which
    is why declaring them was never the same as executing them.
