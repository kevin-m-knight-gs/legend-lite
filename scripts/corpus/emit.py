"""
Emits the portable .pure artefacts: a ###Data element and the 12 services with testSuites.

Everything written here is plain Legend grammar. No part of it is specific to a runner, so
legend-engine executes it through TestableRunner and legend-lite can parse the identical
bytes — which is the portability claim, and parity.py checks it rather than asserting it.

Three details are load-bearing and were established from working examples in
legend-engine rather than guessed:

  * The connection key inside `data: [ connections: [ ... ] ]` is matched against the
    runtime's identifiedConnection **id** when the runtime uses the
    `connections: [ store: [ id: conn ] ]` shape. stress::RT does, and its id is
    `environment` — NOT the connection's element path `store::Conn`. Using the path
    silently seeds nothing and every test returns zero rows.
    (TestRuntimeBuilder.java)

  * `serializationFormat: PURE_TDSOBJECT;` produces `[{"col":val},...]`, which is the
    shape the oracle emits. The default (`DEFAULT`/`PURE`) instead produces
    `{"columns":[...],"rows":[{"values":[...]}]}`. Omitting the line is therefore a
    silent format mismatch, not an error. (TDSResult.getSerializer)

  * The classic `###Data` Relational form carries no store qualifier and no trailing
    semicolon after `}#`. The store-qualified form with `;` belongs to the newer
    `Relation #{...}#` grammar and does not parse here.

Also fixed here, because it is a real defect the old corpus could not see: all 12 services
declared `mapping: stress::RT`, pointing the mapping slot at a *Runtime*. Nothing
resolved that reference, so it survived. It becomes `stress::AllMapping`.
