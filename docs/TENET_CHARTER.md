## Clause 1 — Orchestration: what Java MAY do

Java is the driver, the transport, and the boundary. It MAY:

- **C1.1 — JDBC transport and session management.** Open/close connections, manage
  transactions and savepoints, submit statements, stream results, bound the driver
  (fetch size, timeouts).
- **C1.2 — Typed value CARRIAGE.** Move a value from a `ResultSet` to a consumer without
  computing from it: no arithmetic, no comparison that decides a result, no reformatting
  beyond what the JDBC accessor itself returns for the column's declared type.
- **C1.3 — Compile-time-fact emission ("types drive construction").** Emit envelopes,
  headers, and schemas from the COMPILED PLAN's facts — column names, Pure types,
  multiplicities — never from inspecting values. The CSV header row, the JSON envelope,
  the TDS schema line are model-space artifacts.
- **C1.4 — Control flow.** Statement ordering, phase sequencing, per-statement error
  routing, retry/refusal policy — over OPAQUE results, without reading into them.
- **C1.5 — Byte transport.** Carrying DB-rendered artifacts (a rendered CSV line, a
  DB-built JSON document) to sockets, files, and asserts untouched.
- **C1.6 — Model-space computation.** Anything computed over the MODEL — types, mappings,
  metamodel navigation, plan text, declared column precision lattices — is compilation,
  not execution. `MetamodelWalk` and `GraphEmission` are the certified examples
  (audit §9). The test: could this run with no database attached and no data loaded?

## Clause 2 — Execution: what Java MAY NOT do

Any of the following over a value that crossed (or will cross) a `ResultSet` is execution,
and belongs in the database:

- **C2.1 — Deriving values.** No arithmetic, hashing, string transformation, concatenation,
  or any computation whose input is a result value and whose output reaches a consumer.
- **C2.2 — Deciding types from values.** No type, kind, or multiplicity chosen by
  inspecting a value's magnitude, text shape, or precision (the audit's §6-Q5(b): "reads
  magnitude"). The type is a fact the compiler already owns; ask the plan, never the cell.
- **C2.3 — Reshaping results.** No sorting, filtering, deduplicating, aggregating,
  grouping, slicing, or unnesting of result rows. Row order is the database's; a
  comparison POLICY that tolerates unordered results is legitimate (it judges, it does
  not repair), but it must be gated on a compile-time fact (`sortedChain()`), counted,
  and one-sided.
- **C2.4 — Fabricating values.** No value a consumer can observe that the platform never
  computed: no manufactured UUIDs, no empty collections standing in for unrecorded data,
  no `get(0)` fallbacks, no defaults that lose a type (`default -> "String"`). Absence is
  a loud `NotImplementedException`, never a plausible value.
- **C2.5 — Rendering ruled representations.** No Java rendering of a value whose print
  form has a REPRESENTATION RULE (float repr, date/subsecond forms, decimal scale). Those
  rules live in the SQL emission path (`Scalars.floatRepr`, `DateFmt`) and render in the
  database (Phase 4). The only exception is Clause 4.

## Clause 2b — Platform natives (ratified 2026-08-18)

Tenet #1 governs DATA evaluation: any value derived from stored data reaches the user
through SQL. It does NOT require pushing every Pure construct into the database. A
legend-pure semantic may be implemented as a NATIVE JAVA PLATFORM FUNCTION where pushing
it down is senseless or wrong — asserts, unordered/multiset checks, metamodel operations,
comparison policies over already-produced results. Three conditions make such a native
legitimate rather than a shadow implementation: (1) ONE owner, in the platform
({@code com.legend}), on the compiled surface — never a harness-private copy; (2) the
engine/legend-pure {@code .pure} source is the SPEC it is ported from and verified
against; (3) it is registered — the eval ledger distinguishes "platform native" from
"evaluation residue awaiting eviction". This is how legend-pure itself is built (the
reference interpreter's natives are Java); an implementation of Pure is not un-Pure for
having Java natives. What remains banned: data-derived values computed host-side, and
SECOND implementations of semantics the platform already owns (the harness's private
equality/envelope/decode copies are migration targets, not exemplars).

## Clause 2c — Two worlds, one spec (ratified 2026-08-19, phase-2 deep audit)

Equality (and every value semantic) necessarily exists in TWO worlds: **World 1 — the
host adjudication layer** (`PureAsserts`/`GridCompare`/`JsonCompare`: comparing an
EXPECTED value against a FETCHED result to produce a test verdict), and **World 2 — the
compiler** (an in-query `x == y` must lower to SQL; the lowering rules ARE that world).
World 2 cannot not exist — it is the compiler; World 1 is Clause 2b's adjudication
grant. The doctrine: **verdicts are World 1's job, in-query computation is World 2's,
and NEITHER world reimplements the other's job.** Compiling the assert library's pure
bodies into SQL to produce verdicts violates this clause exactly as a harness-private
comparator does (the Phase-4 seam arms were this violation's cost, witnessed). Both
worlds cite the same legend-pure spec; their agreement on shared ground — and every
DECLARED divergence (SQL null-vs-pure-true, dialect coercions) — is pinned by the
`EqualityWorldsConformanceTest` fixture: drift in either world is a red test, never a
discovery made three phases later.

**Z2 ruling — verdict-channel scope (ratified 2026-08-19).** World 1's equality
(`PureAsserts.equalScalar`/`equal`) carries three kinds of arm, adjudicated separately:
**SPEC** arms (integral×Decimal numeric equality, scale-blind Decimal, IEEE
non-finite — witnessed pure semantics, sound for any caller); **CARRIER-DECODE**
bridges (the temporal string carrier — the platform's designed wire representation,
sound for any consumer of the wire); and **TEST-CHANNEL TOLERANCES** (the TDSNull
sentinel, the 2-ULP dialect-arithmetic leniency — sound ONLY because every caller is
an adjudicator). The ruling: `PureAsserts` equality is the VERDICT CHANNEL and nothing
else. Product equality is World 2 — an in-query `equal()` lowers to SQL and the
database is the authority — so no product surface may route value equality through
`PureAsserts`; if a genuine product host-side equality need ever appears, it gets its
own SPEC-ONLY comparator (no tolerance arms) as a witnessed design leg. Enforced
mechanically: `VerdictChannelRegisterTest` pins the caller file set (comment-stripped
source scan) to the adjudication cluster — a new caller is a red build until
consciously registered here with its tenet argument.

## Clause 3 — Provenance, not arms (the host channel)

**No `ResultSet`-derived value may be EVALUATED in Java on the host channel.** The
invariant is on the PROVENANCE of the value, never on an interpreter arm list: audit §8
proved a ~6-line dispatch edge reclassified all 47 then-existing arms at once — 18 were
dual-use (`fold`, `map`, `at`, `size`, `eq`, `in`, `filter`…) and became execution the
moment a data-space value flowed through them. *(Re-scoped 2026-08-18,
`ADVERSARIAL_TENET_AUDIT_2026_08_18.md` §5: `HostEval.eval()` no longer exists — the
interpreter was DELETED under the oracle-not-runtime principle.)* Today the host channel
is `GridReads.tryLower` (grid chains COMPILE to SQL; DB values flow only through carriage
into results, never through computation) and `StoreNav` (compiled-model reads, no DB
values), and everything else walls loudly. Enforcement: the interpreter's nonexistence,
`ArchitectureTest.theInterpreterPerformsNoJdbc`, and the `JavaEvalLedgerTest` register.
Known enforcement limits are recorded in the audit's §3 — the guards catch drift, not
adversaries; residue DELETION (the relation-typed `fetchDb` leg) is the durable fix.

## Clause 4 — The literal exception, once (the LiteralFold rule)

Java may answer without the database ONLY for a value that satisfies both conditions:

1. **Syntactic value, zero computation** — the value appears VERBATIM in the typed AST
   (a bare literal node), never a composite, variable, or call.
2. **Representation-trivial round trip** — no coercion, width, scale, or format rule would
   be applied on the SQL path. If a rule exists, answering in Java duplicates the rule in
   a second place, and the answer belongs to the database even for a literal.

The canonical instance is `LiteralFold.ADMITTED = {String, Boolean}` — Integer fails
(driver width + lattice promotion), Float/Decimal fail (scale/format), Date fails
(partial-date carriers). The admitted set is pinned differentially by
`ConstantPlanParityTest`: **admitting a kind is a green differential, not an argument.**

The SAME rule with the SAME pinning mechanism governs every other Java-answers-locally
site: Phase 4's literal identity-render arm, and any future fold. One rule, N
applications, zero new judgment calls. A site that wants a wider set must first widen
`LiteralFold` behind a green differential — there are no site-local admission rules.

## Clause 5 — The ingress mirror

Ingress obeys the same split in reverse:

- **C5.1** — Values entering the database (CSV seeds, JSON payloads, generated data) are
  bound as literals/parameters and the DATABASE casts them to the model's column types —
  "uniform policy, no host-side type dispatch" (`TestDataGenerator.loadSide` is the
  certified instance). Java never types an ingress token by regexing its text while the
  resolved column type is in scope (the typed-fact test).
- **C5.2** — Model-derived SQL is spelled correctly the FIRST time from the type in hand.
  Java never emits text it must then rewrite (`RawSqlBoundary` is for corpus-AUTHORED
  text only — text whose origin is another dialect).

## Enforcement map

| Clause | Mechanical enforcement |
|---|---|
| C1/C2 boundary | F1.3 `java.sql` funnel (+ F1.3b root class-list pin); F1.10 tenet ratchet over ResultSet-consumption sites outside the C1.2/C1.5/Clause-4 seam |
| C2.3 | F1.4 positive harness rule (`sortedChain()`-gated, enumerated allowlist) |
| Clause 2c Z2 | `VerdictChannelRegisterTest` (caller file-set pin over `PureAsserts.equal*`) |
| Clause 3 | F1.5 `HostChannelPredicateTest` |
| Clause 4 | `ConstantPlanParityTest` (exists); Phase 4 render arm cites it |
| C5.2 | F1.6 R0 ledger (shrink-only) → F7.4 makes the contract true |

Until a clause's enforcement lands, the clause still governs adjudication — "the guard is
not built yet" is a schedule fact, not a license.
