# Embedded MariaDB as a real backend — design

> **Question asked:** add a MariaDB/MySQL-flavoured backend, embedded so it runs in CI with no
> Docker, on the same terms `H2_BACKEND.md` asked for H2. There is no golden-text half: the engine's
> corpus has no MariaDB goldens, so **row equality is the only contract**.
>
> **Companions:** `H2_BACKEND.md` (the method), `SQLITE_BACKEND.md`, `POSTGRES_BACKEND.md`,
> `BACKEND_PORTABILITY.md` (the cross-cutting architecture).

**Evidence standard.** The capability map was produced by **executing ~1,150 probe statements
against a real embedded MariaDB 11.4.5** (MariaDB4j), every probe also run against DuckDB 1.5.0.0 as
the reference value, through one shared harness. **Value equality was checked, not just parse
success.** Where documentation and execution disagreed, execution won — **and it did, on the headline
question**. Session as probed:

```
sql_mode = IGNORE_SPACE,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,
           NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
character_set_server = utf8mb4 · collation_server = utf8mb4_general_ci
time_zone = SYSTEM · max_recursive_iterations = 1000
```

**Note what is *not* in that `sql_mode`: `ANSI_QUOTES`, `PIPES_AS_CONCAT`, `NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES`,
`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`.** The first three are correctness-critical for legend-lite (§4). The fourth is
widely documented as a MariaDB default and **is not one** — that claim is refuted by execution.

---

## 1. Verdict

**Achievable and strong — 97% reachable, zero impossible constructs in the entire shapes slice. But
it is gated behind a single session flag, and without that flag every query silently returns column
names as data.**

- **201 of 207 constructs reachable — 97%.** Only **6 D's**, all in the scalar slice.
- **H2's fatal wall does not transfer.** `LATERAL` really is absent — but **`JSON_TABLE` exists on
  MariaDB 11.4.5 and correlates**, which is the capability that matters. §3.
- **`ANSI_QUOTES` is the gate.** legend-lite quotes every identifier with `"`. Without the flag,
  `SELECT "name"` returns the *string* `'name'`. §4.
- **The `B` column is 89 of 207** — MariaDB reaches almost everything, but usually by rewrite rather
  than natively. It is the most *rewrite-hungry* backend measured, and correspondingly the one where
  a thin spelling table would be most misleading.
- **`ROUND` and `ROUND_HALF_UP` are both wrong, in opposite directions**, unless the argument type is
  forced. §5.
- **Embedded, no Docker, ~7s boot** — with a packaging caveat on macOS ARM64. §10.

## 2. The capability map — 207 constructs

| Slice | A native | C rendering | B rewrite | D impossible | total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Strings / math / temporal (scalar) | 47 | 22 | 36 | **6** | 111 |
| `LIST_*` / `UNNEST` / `RANGE_FN` | 0 | 6 | 24 | 0 | 30 |
| `MAP_*` | 0 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 7 |
| Variant / JSON | 1 | 4 | 4 | 0 | 9 |
| Sources & joins | 7 | 1 | 6 | 0 | 14 |
| Aggregates & windows | 10 | 1 | 11 | 0 | 22 |
| Types | 6 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 14 |
| **Total** | **71** | **41** | **89** | **6** | **207** |
| | 34% | 20% | 43% | **3%** | |

**Reachable (A+C+B) = 201/207 = 97%. Zero D's outside the scalar slice.**

> **Denominator caveat.** 207 is this slice's partition — *not* the 267 used for SQLite/Postgres, and
> not `H2_BACKEND.md`'s 256. The three studies partition the construct surface differently.
> Percentages are comparable in spirit; **the counts are not subtractable.**

---

## 3. `JSON_TABLE` exists, and it correlates

`LATERAL` is genuinely absent — every spelling is a parse error. But that is only half of H2's D1,
and it is the half that does not matter:

```sql
-- correlated explosion against a real table column: OK, SUM = 100
SELECT SUM(jt.v) FROM arrtab t, JSON_TABLE(t.arr, '$[*]' COLUMNS (v INT PATH '$')) jt;
```

Correlation works on a **column** and on an **arbitrary expression over the outer row**. This
contradicts the widespread claim that `JSON_TABLE` is MySQL-only: it landed in **MariaDB 10.6**
(MDEV-17399).

> **Record the version threshold.** MariaDB **10.5 and earlier really are H2-shaped** — no
> `JSON_TABLE`, no `LATERAL`, no correlated explosion. The minimum supported MariaDB is therefore
> **10.6**, and that is a hard floor, not a preference.

**So MariaDB's collection story is Postgres-shaped, not H2-shaped** — a different mechanism with the
same capability. The `LIST_*` family is reachable by rewrite: 0 A, 6 C, **24 B**, 0 D.

`JSON_TABLE` is not a thin capability: it chains, nests, and takes `FOR ORDINALITY`, `NESTED PATH`,
`EXISTS PATH` and `ON EMPTY`. `LEFT JOIN JSON_TABLE(…) ON TRUE` preserves the empty-array row —
`LEFT_LATERAL` exactly.

**What `LATERAL`'s absence still costs, measured:** only **per-row top-N** and **per-row
multi-aggregate**, both of which rewrite to window or grouped-join forms with values equal to
DuckDB. Two independent fallbacks also execute: the `seq_M_to_N` SEQUENCE engine with a correlated
predicate, and a recursive-CTE `JSON_EXTRACT(arr, CONCAT('$[',n,']'))` index walk.

That second fallback is load-bearing beyond its size: **the index walk is what delivers `FoldCall`
and `LIST_REDUCE`, which `JSON_TABLE` alone cannot express.** Note the tension with §7 — it is also
the construction bounded by `max_recursive_iterations`.

Unlike SQLite, **MariaDB's recursive CTEs cannot be row-correlated** — which is exactly why
`LEVENSHTEIN` and `JARO_WINKLER` are D here but B on SQLite (§6).

---

## 4. The gate — `ANSI_QUOTES`, and three more session flags

**This is the most severe finding in the entire four-backend study.**

| Setting | Default | What happens silently if left unset |
|---|---|---|
| **`ANSI_QUOTES`** | **off** | `SELECT "name" FROM emp` returns the **string `'name'`**, not `alice`. legend-lite quotes **every** identifier with `"`, so **every column reference becomes a constant.** A query returns a rectangle of column names. No error, anywhere. |
| **`PIPES_AS_CONCAT`** | off | `'a' \|\| 'b'` → **`0`**. `\|\|` is OR. Parses, returns a number, never raises. |
| **`NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES`** | off | `LENGTH('\\')` is 1, not 2 — **every regex pattern is corrupted at parse time.** |
| **collation** | `utf8mb4_general_ci` | case-**insensitive** *and* PAD SPACE: `'abc'='ABC'` **true**, `'abc'='abc '` **true**. `utf8mb4_bin` fixes case but **not** padding; only **`utf8mb4_nopad_bin`** matches DuckDB. |
| **`time_zone`** | `SYSTEM` | `UNIX_TIMESTAMP` is off by the host offset. |

Verified by mutating the session and re-probing, not by reading documentation.

> **The collation row is different in kind from the other four, and the difference is a trap.**
> `sql_mode` flags are genuinely session-scoped, but **session `collation_connection` does not
> override a column's declared collation.** Collation must be pinned at **server and DDL scope** —
> which means it is a property of how legend-lite *creates tables*, not of how it connects. That is
> the same defect class as H2's forked `charPadding` (`H2_BACKEND.md` §7), reappearing on a second
> backend: string comparison semantics are a *storage* decision that the query layer cannot repair.

`CAST` is also non-validating here, as on SQLite: `CAST('abc' AS SIGNED)` → **`0`**, silently.

> These are not spelling and not capability — they are **configuration that must be owned and
> asserted**, the unowned-responsibility problem `BACKEND_PORTABILITY.md` §4 describes. MariaDB is
> the sharpest instance: one flag separates "works" from "uniformly wrong, silently."

## 5. Silent value divergences

Every row executes cleanly and returns a wrong value.

| | DuckDB | MariaDB |
|---|---|---|
| `ROUND(x)` on a **DOUBLE** | half away from zero | **banker's** |
| `ROUND(x)` on a **DECIMAL** | half away from zero | half-up |
| `REGEXP_REPLACE` | **first** match only | **all** matches — *same function name* |
| `TIMESTAMPDIFF('month', …)` | boundary crossings | **complete units** — 2→1, year 1→0, hour 2→1 |
| `DATEDIFF` | — | **argument order inverted** on top of the counting rule |
| `-8 >> 1` | `-4` | **`9223372036854775804`** — all bitwise ops evaluate **unsigned** |
| `LENGTH('héllo')` | characters | **bytes** |
| `GREATEST(a,NULL)`, `CONCAT(a,NULL)` | skips NULL | **propagates NULL** |
| `PI()` | full precision | **truncates to 7 digits** |
| `MAKEDATE(y, n)` | `make_date(y,m,d)` | **different function** — day-of-year, arity collision |
| `WEEK()` | ISO | needs **mode 3** for ISO |
| `DAYOFWEEK` / `WEEKDAY` | — | **two different bases, neither DuckDB's** |
| default NULL ordering | LAST/LAST | **FIRST on ASC, LAST on DESC — and `NULLS FIRST/LAST` is a parse error** |

**Both rounding SqlFns are wrong and they fail in opposite directions.** `AnsiSqlRenderer.java:441-444`
renders `ROUND` as a half-even composite and `ROUND_HALF_UP` as bare SQL `ROUND` — on MariaDB the
bare form is banker's for DOUBLE and half-up for DECIMAL, so the argument type silently picks the
mode. Both need an explicit cast to pin it.

---

## 5.1 Graph fetch — survives, with one mandatory cast

The nested object-graph envelope runs in **one statement**, three levels deep, using
`JSON_ARRAYAGG`/`JSON_OBJECT`. Verified: ordered aggregation; `COALESCE(…, JSON_ARRAY())` for empty
collections; NULL elements kept. **The expected double-encoding weak spot is absent** — nested JSON
stays JSON, and a `JSON`-typed column nests identically to DuckDB.

One real defect, and it is subtle:

> A **numeric correlated scalar subquery** inside a `JSON_OBJECT` **alongside a string sibling**
> serialises as a JSON **string**: `{"n":"2"}` where DuckDB gives `{"n":2}`. Cause is charset
> aggregation over the subquery's `binary` charset. **Fix: an explicit `CAST` on the numeric member.**

The same root cause makes the driver hand back **`byte[]`** for the envelope — the H2 precedent from
`H2_BACKEND.md` §3 — fixed by wrapping the envelope in `CAST(… AS CHAR)`.

Note this is a *type-dependent, sibling-dependent* serialisation bug: the numeric member is only
mis-typed when a string sibling is present. A graph-fetch test with a single scalar member would pass
and the defect would surface later on a wider object.

---

## 6. The six D's — each with what was tried

| | Why |
|---|---|
| `SPLIT`, `REGEXP_EXTRACT_ALL` | **no ARRAY type.** This is the collection-carrier wall, not a spelling gap — under a JSON carrier both become B. |
| `LEVENSHTEIN`, `JARO_WINKLER` | no built-in. Recursive CTEs work in scalar subqueries but **cannot be row-correlated**, which is the primitive SQLite used to reclaim exactly these two as B. |
| `TYPEOF` | **downgradeable to C** — column types are statically known from `information_schema`. |
| `TIMEZONE` | a **deployment** gap, not an engine gap: `mysql.time_zone_name` is empty in the embedded image, so named zones return NULL. Numeric offsets work. Loading the tz tables fixes it. |

Only two are true capability walls; the rest are carrier, deployment, or downgradeable.

---

## 7. Capability budget (`H2_BACKEND.md` §8 shape)

| Budget | H2 | **MariaDB 11.4.5** |
|---|---|---|
| `aliasLimit` | 256 | **64** for any DDL identifier (65 → *"Identifier name … is too long"*). SELECT aliases accept ≥257, so 64 binds. |
| `collectionThresholdLimit` | not set | **not set** — the IN→temp-table rewrite is unnecessary; `JSON_TABLE` over one JSON parameter is strictly better. Text bounded by `max_allowed_packet`. |
| `supportsFullOuterJoin` | false | **false** — UNION-of-LEFT-and-RIGHT rewrite, verified (B). |
| `supportsBooleanLiteral` | true | **true** — `TRUE`/`FALSE` parse, but read back as `Integer`. |
| `limitStyle` | `top N` / `offset…fetch` | **`LIMIT n OFFSET m`** — DuckDB-identical. No `TOP`. Offset-only needs `LIMIT 18446744073709551615 OFFSET n`. |
| `nullOrdering` | explicit | **implicit and inverted** — needs the `expr IS NULL` rewrite, not just a flag. |
| `max_recursive_iterations` | — | **1000, and it truncates silently.** A recursive-CTE rewrite that exceeds it returns *fewer rows*, not an error. **Budget row.** |

That last row deserves emphasis: with 89 constructs reaching MariaDB by **rewrite**, and several of
those rewrites being recursive CTEs, a silent 1000-row ceiling is a correctness cliff, not a
performance note.

---

## 8. `SqlDialect.normalize` — nineteen rows

The largest normalize surface of any backend measured (H2 four, Postgres four, SQLite eight).
Led by:

| | JDBC returns | canonical |
|---|---|---|
| `BOOLEAN` | **`Integer`** (`TINYINT(1)` alias) | `Boolean` |
| bitwise results | **`BigInteger`** (unsigned) | signed 64-bit |
| `SUM` | **`BigDecimal`** (DuckDB: `BigInteger`) | integer |
| `JSON` | `String` — `JSON` is a `LONGTEXT` alias, not a real type | JSON |

---

## 9. MariaDB vs MySQL

The project may target either; they diverge on exactly the things this doc turns on.

| | MariaDB 11.4 | MySQL 8+ |
|---|---|---|
| `JSON_TABLE` | **yes** (10.6+) | yes |
| `LATERAL` | **no** | **yes** (8.0.14+) |
| `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` default | **no** | **yes** |
| `JSON` type | `LONGTEXT` alias | real type with binary storage |
| `INTERSECT` / `EXCEPT` | yes (10.3+) | 8.0.31+ |

**MySQL is the strictly stronger target** (it has `LATERAL` and a real JSON type) but the stricter
default `sql_mode`. A dialect written against MariaDB should run on MySQL; the reverse is not true.

---

## 10. Standing it up — and a packaging caveat

```xml
<dependency><groupId>ch.vorburger.mariaDB4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>mariaDB4j</artifactId><version>3.3.1</version></dependency>
<dependency><groupId>ch.vorburger.mariaDB4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>mariaDB4j-db-macos-arm64</artifactId><version>11.4.5</version></dependency>
<dependency><groupId>org.mariadb.jdbc</groupId>
            <artifactId>mariadb-java-client</artifactId><version>3.5.10</version></dependency>
```

Real MariaDB server, **~7s boot**, no Docker, no root. Note the binaries artifact carries the
**MariaDB** version (`11.4.5`), not the framework's — using `3.3.1` fails to resolve.

> **Caveat, macOS ARM64 only.** The `mariaDB4j-db-macos-arm64` artifact is **not self-contained**:
> `mariadbd` dynamically links `/opt/homebrew/opt/pcre2/lib/libpcre2-8.0.dylib`, which need not
> exist on a machine without Homebrew. `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` does **not** work around it,
> because MariaDB4j launches `mariadbd` through the SIP-protected `/bin/sh` script
> `mariadb-install-db` and macOS strips `DYLD_*` across that exec. The fix used here was to build
> pcre2 from source and rewrite the load path with `install_name_tool` + an ad-hoc `codesign`,
> patched **inside the jar** so it survives MariaDB4j's re-extraction. **Linux CI is unaffected** —
> `mariaDB4j-db-linux64` does not have this dependency. Flag it as a local-dev setup step, not a
> blocker.

---

## 11. Sequencing

1. **Pin the session** (§4) — `ANSI_QUOTES`, `PIPES_AS_CONCAT`, `NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES`,
   `utf8mb4_nopad_bin`, `time_zone`. Nothing else in this document matters until this is done, and it
   must be **asserted** at connection open, not merely appended to a URL.
2. **Pin the minimum version at MariaDB 10.6** (§3). Below it, the backend is H2-shaped.
3. **Force the argument type on both rounding SqlFns** (§5).
4. **Author `Lexicon.MARIADB` / `TypeNames.MARIADB` / `Spellings.MARIADB`**, plus the rewrite passes —
   note 89 constructs are B, so the rewrite passes are the bulk of the work, not the spelling table.
5. **Populate `SqlDialect.normalize`** — nineteen rows (§8).
6. **Add `max_recursive_iterations` to the capability budget** and raise it, or wall the rewrites that
   depend on it (§7).
7. **Load the tz tables** in the embedded image to reclaim `TIMEZONE` (§6).
8. **The declared-gap registry** — 6 D's, of which only 2 are true capability walls.
9. **Portability sweep** `-Drcorpus.backend=mariadb`.

---

## 12. What NOT to do

- **Don't connect without `ANSI_QUOTES`** (§4). Every quoted identifier silently becomes a string
  literal. This is the single highest-severity configuration risk found across all four backends.
- **Don't support MariaDB < 10.6** (§3) — no `JSON_TABLE` means H2's wall, for real.
- **Don't trust `sql_mode` documentation** — `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` is *not* a MariaDB default, and
  `JSON_TABLE` is *not* MySQL-only. Both claims were refuted by execution.
- **Don't reuse DuckDB's `REGEXP_REPLACE` semantics** — same name, first-match vs global (§5).
- **Don't build rewrites on recursive CTEs without bounding them** — 1000 iterations, truncated
  silently (§7).
- **Don't assume `LENGTH` or bitwise ops are portable** — bytes not characters, unsigned not signed.
