"""One package, two things (the user, 2026-10-15): ``pip install legend-lite`` is the compiler alone, which needs only
Python's standard library; ``pip install 'legend-lite[datacube]'`` is DataCube, with everything it needs -- duckdb (the
frames' database), pyarrow (their rows), and mini-racer's V8, which runs DataCube's own code (its rules, written once,
are asked of it: never copied into Python). Every module of DataCube's asks ``require_datacube()`` before it imports
any of them, so a compiler-only install that reaches for DataCube is told what to install, once, in one sentence."""
